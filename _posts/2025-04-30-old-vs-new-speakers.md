Recently my daughter developed a keen urge to buy a turntable and some vinyl, and then asked me how much I may have stored away. This ended up with me bringing 5 boxes down from the loft, and at some point my own turntable when I find it. I now also have been given some excellent 1970s speakers which I will hopefully attach to a 1970's amplifier and 1970's cassette deck, and 1990's turntable.

Why the 1970's when there is 50 years of improvements to enjoy? Well, the speakers were free but would be a couple of grand in new money, and a recommended equivalent is at least Â£3k but may not sound as good according to reviews. I'm not an audiophile by any means but I do like to listen to music, I do this all the time and it keeps me almost sane. I therefore can justify a decent set up but not the modern cost of one.

Do we constantly need to 'upgrade' to the law of diminishing returns? Embrace the past and dig the old kit out of the loft. I never tire of the soft crackle and rumble of vinyl that has been played over and over, music was never meant to sound so clinical.

<H2>Jamesthomson.org.uk V1 (2007-2025)</H2>
<p>I had been hosting jamesthomson.org.uk for some time on my own pc in the kitchen...This caused a few issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine had to be on 24/7</li>
<li>Any VPN usage had to be quick</li>
<li>The original site was made in Adobe Flash</li>
<li>I was on a dynamic IP</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have a few sites working from my PC, originally editing was easy through Dreamweaver but as the complexity grew so did the upkeep time. I last edited the original flash file some years ago but had done so much more since </p>

<H2>EchoesofPerception.com (2024-2025, brand still going)</h2>
<p>I decided in 2024 to launch 'Echoes of Perception', a brand that would be used on Youtube, Twitter (X), Facebook etc. to showcase some of the work I was doing. I bought a new website, wordpress hosting and created the social profiles. After throwing some time at it I didn't update the site and before you know it the billing is coming around again. It's not that I don't like Wordpress, but it's clunkier than just being able to throw some words together and having a brand that was seperate to my name didn't really do anything to showcase who was doing the work. I needed a rethink!</p>

<H2>Jamesthomson.org.uk V2 (2025-)</h2>
<p>I had been using Git Pages for some time but just for small projects linked to my work with the HND in Computing at Sheffield College. I decided to unlink jamesthomson.org.uk from my own PC and drop in onto my GitHub site. This gives me an excuse to tidy that site up as well..</p>
<p>I found videos to help me set up a very decent jekyll theme - al-folio which seems to work well as the basis for my site. The work starts now to populate (and keep populating) it.</p>

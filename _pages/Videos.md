<h2>Videos</h2>
I have three YouTube Channels
<p>The original channel has been going for a long time and is mostly gig videos I have filmed for local bands</p>

<p>The Echoes of Perception brand came about when I bought a drone and wanted to put videos up of it, not wanting to bother the musical subscribers</p>

<p>The 5 Minute View From The Kop was created recently as YouTube now allows automatic import from an rss feed so I brought this in from Spotify to get a wider audience</p>

<h2>2005-2007: Cert Ed</h2>
I went to Chesterfield College as a technician but primarily my goal was to become a teacher
<H2>2006: Teaching started</h2>
Alongside my Cert Ed I managed initially after some reluctance by the college to get teaching on the HNC Computing
Website Development using ASP
I already had a comprehensive custom-built website from my time at Motografix using ASP, VbScript and an MS Access database so I used this self-taught knowledge to deliver some sessions on HTML, ASP etc.. to HNC Students (for free)
<h2>2009: Stepping Into the Computing Team</h2>
<h2>2010: A Full-Time Computing Lecturer</h2>
<h2>2012: Timetabling My Own Classes</h2>
<h2>2018: Back On Home Turf</h2>
A restructure at Chesterfield had left me without a management job and fortunately just as my time came to a close at Chesterfield an opening came up at Sheffield in a similar role. I once again had the opportunity to cherry pick my classes and subjects
<ul>
    <li>Website Design</li>
    <li>Internet of Things</li>
    <li>Big Data</li>
    <li>Level 4 Data Analyst</li>
    <li>Augmented and Virtual Reality</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Game Development</li>
</ul>
<h2>2020: A Switch to Engineering</h2>
By this time I had taken on Engineering and moved my teaching there. My degree was in design including product design and so I gave myself subjects to fit with my skills from my studies and also my time in Computing, Manufacturing and Electronic Engineering
<ul>
    <li>Design</li>
    <li>Project</li>
    <li>Communications</li>
    <li>Engineering Drawing</li>
    <li>Engineering Representations</li>
    <li>Mechatronics</li>
</ul>

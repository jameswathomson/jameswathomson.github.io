<p><b>Work: </b>An experienced and innovative manager with over a decade of leadership in technology and engineering industries. I combine a strong technical foundation with creative problem-solving, bridging the gap between artistry, technology and engineering to drive impactful solutions.</p>
<p><b>Life: </b>Married with kids. Long-term suffering Sheffield Wednesday supporter, biker, sci-fi and film buff, ðŸ¤˜musicðŸ¤˜, trying to be a decent human and expecting the same from others.
I created this site to showcase a few things I'm interested in which sometimes relate to work and sometimes don't. </p>
<p>Learning is for life, I enjoy picking up new skills and passing these on to my family and students. I'm currently split between podcasting, cooking and drone piloting, check out my content using the links above</p>
<p>This site is a constant work in progress.</p>
